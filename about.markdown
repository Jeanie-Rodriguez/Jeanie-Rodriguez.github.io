I'm a dedicated professional with over 20 years of experience in the United States Air Force as a Weather Technician. My career has been marked by a passion for delivering high-quality work with a focus on precision, reliability, effective communication, and innovative problem-solving.

I have extensive experience in operations and project management and in creating and managing a variety of personnel and technical documentation. Iâ€™m a very organized and detail-oriented person with a genuine love of writing, reading, and editing.

I am currently seeking a role that leverages my expertise and knowledge while also providing opportunities for professional growth.
