I have a strong appreciation for well-crafted infographics. Recently, Iâ€™ve taken the initiative to design my own to effectively break down and communicate complex processes and concepts to my teams and stakeholders.

This particular infographic, created in Canva, illustrates the process for submitting improvement proposals to Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (best practice guides), along with a side-by-side comparison of the approval processes for both categories of these guides.

The information was originally scattered across three comprehensive documents and not presented in a straightforward manner. Developing this infographic required extensive research and close collaboration with subject matter experts to ensure its accuracy.
