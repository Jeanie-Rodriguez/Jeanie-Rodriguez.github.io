This infographic was created in Canva and was ultimately distributed to 87 offices. It explains how employees can submit their ideas for inclusion in Air Force Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (*best practice guides*) and illustrates the approval process for both categories using a side-by-side comparison. 

To develop this infographic, I conducted extensive research of source materials and collborated with subject matter experts to ensure accuracy.
