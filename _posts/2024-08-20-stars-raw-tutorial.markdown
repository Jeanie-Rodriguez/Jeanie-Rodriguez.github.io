This short tutorial was created in Micosoft Teams and is used for internal training. It provides a step-by-step guide on creating and saving customized reports on a website (*STARS/RAW*).

As part of a series, this training video was developed to fill a documentation gap and assist future team members in mastering these processes. Prior to this, there was no formal documentation available.
