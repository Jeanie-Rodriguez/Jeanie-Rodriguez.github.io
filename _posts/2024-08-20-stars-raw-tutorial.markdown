This short tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on creating and saving customized reports on the STARS/RAW website. These reports are essential for updating weekly manning statistics for a division comprising 1,900 employees.

As part of a series of training videos, this resource was developed to fill a documentation gap and assist future team members in mastering these processes. Prior to this, there was no formal documentation available.

I created this video using Microsoft Teams, as the Air Force network restricts the use of other software applications.
