In Air Force weather, every work center is required to document Standard Operating Procedures that cover an established set of topics.

Throughout my career, I have consistently taken the lead in writing, editing, and managing these SOPs across all the work centers Iâ€™ve been a part of. I have developed SOPs using Microsoft Word and Adobe PDF, which encompass a diverse array of topics, including:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Terminal Aerodrome Forecast Procedures</td>
        <td>Manual Observing Procedures</td>
        <td>Pilot Report & Pilot-to-Metro Procedures</td> 
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Weather Watch, Warning, & Advisory Procedures</td>
        <td>Severe Weather Team Procedures</td>
        <td>Continuity of Operations Procedures</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Emergency Evacuation Procedures</td>
        <td>Equipment Outage Procedures</td>
        <td>Aircraft Mishap Response Procedures</td>
    </tr>
</table>

This is an excerpt from an SOP I created which provides step-by-step instructions for updating a comprehensive Excel spreadsheet that tracks manning data for a division of 1,900 employees. This SOP was created to address a lack of documentation and to help future team members efficiently learn these processes.
